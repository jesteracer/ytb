  @doc """
  Binds a YouTube broadcast to a stream or removes an existing binding between a broadcast and a stream. A broadcast can only be bound to one video stream, though a video stream may be bound to more than one broadcast.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.YouTube.V3.Connection): Connection to server
  - id (String): The id parameter specifies the unique ID of the broadcast that is being bound to a video stream.
  - part (String): The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more liveBroadcast resource properties that the API response will include. The part names that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, contentDetails, and status.
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :on_behalf_of_content_owner (String): Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.  The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#39;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
    - :on_behalf_of_content_owner_channel (String): This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.  The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.  This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
    - :stream_id (String): The streamId parameter specifies the unique ID of the video stream that is being bound to a broadcast. If this parameter is omitted, the API will remove any existing binding between the broadcast and a video stream.

    - :display_slate (Boolean): The displaySlate parameter specifies whether the slate is being enabled or disabled.
    - :offset_time_ms (String): The offsetTimeMs parameter specifies a positive time offset when the specified slate change will occur. The value is measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the broadcast&#39;s monitor stream, which is the time that the testing phase for the broadcast began. Even though it is specified in milliseconds, the value is actually an approximation, and YouTube completes the requested action as closely as possible to that time.  If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then YouTube performs the action as soon as possible. See the Getting started guide for more details.  Important: You should only specify a value for this parameter if your broadcast stream is delayed.
    - :on_behalf_of_content_owner (String): Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
    - :walltime (String): The walltime parameter specifies the wall clock time at which the specified slate change will occur. The value is specified in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ) format.

  Changes the status of a YouTube live broadcast and initiates any processes associated with the new status. For example, when you transition a broadcast&#39;s status to testing, YouTube starts to transmit video to that broadcast&#39;s monitor stream.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.YouTube.V3.Connection): Connection to server

  Updates a broadcast. For example, you could modify the broadcast settings defined in the liveBroadcast resource&#39;s contentDetails object.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.YouTube.V3.Connection): Connection to server
  - part (String): The part parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include.  The part properties that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, contentDetails, and status.  Note that this method will override the existing values for all of the mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the parameter value specifies. For example, a broadcast&#39;s privacy status is defined in the status part. As such, if your request is updating a private or unlisted broadcast, and the request&#39;s part parameter value includes the status part, the broadcast&#39;s privacy setting will be updated to whatever value the request body specifies. If the request body does not specify a value, the existing privacy setting will be removed and the broadcast will revert to the default privacy setting.
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :on_behalf_of_content_owner (String): Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.  The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#39;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
    - :on_behalf_of_content_owner_channel (String): This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.  The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.  This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
